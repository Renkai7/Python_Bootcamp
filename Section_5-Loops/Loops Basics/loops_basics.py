fruits = ["Apple", "Peach", "Pear"]
# For loop
#   takes list of 'fruits' and assigns variable: fruit to each item in list
#   fruit value for each pass: 1st pass- fruit = Apple, 2nd pass- fruit = Peach, etc.
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)
    print(fruit + " Pie")

# Notes
#  - rule of thumb: use singular word for items in a list (ex. fruit for fruits list)
