# How I worked on this project

---
My goal was to create a blog website that allows authorized users to: create, update, and delete posts.

# How to navigate this project

---
- Routes to GET and POST register, login, and blog post forms: [Example code](https://github.com/Renkai7/Python_Bootcamp/blob/main/Section_69-Blog-Add_Users/main.py)
- Main page that uses for loop to generate each blog post: [Example code](https://github.com/Renkai7/Python_Bootcamp/blob/main/Section_69-Blog-Add_Users/templates/index.html)

# Why I built the project this way

---
- I used Bootstrap for styling to focus on the logic and back-end such as: database and routing.

# If I had more time I would change this

---
- Add a categories section to organize blog posts 

## Getting Started
Open http://127.0.0.1:5000 with your browser to see the blog page.
